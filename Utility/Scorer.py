"""
This module is meant to find potentially problematic samples
in the data you are using. There are two types: The alignment
scorer and the TTS scorer. The alignment scorer can help you
find mispronunciations or errors in the labels. The TTS scorer
can help you find outliers in the audio part of text-audio pairs.
