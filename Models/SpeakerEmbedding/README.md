Models taken from [this excellent repository](https://github.com/yistLin/dvector). They are compiled as jit models and
thus need no additional code to be loaded, the architecture and weights are all within those files. Due to their small
size and these files never being affected by any changes, they are included in the IMS-Toucan repository, in order to
simplify the installation.
